 | A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
 | The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ñ… 99.
 | Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 | Glossary:
 | a-number - first 3-digit number used for making palindromic number
 | b-number - second 3-digit number used for making palindromic number
